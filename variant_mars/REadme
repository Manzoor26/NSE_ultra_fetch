=======variant mars=====

contains the code for pulling the data for particular dates (partial automation)

--->In the hot_vanilla.py, change the variable days_for_data_needed to the desired date, which fetches the data and processes it.

--->Month variable at the start can be changed to get the data for the desired month 

changing the days_for_data_needed and the month variable may be useful for fetching the specific date's data  


                 ****run hot vanilla first**** 
    +++++++++++++ make sure both the flavour_mars_main.py an hot_vanilla are on the same folder++++++++++++
